The text reads: 'Two years ago, I was agonizing over whether I should continue my engineering career or pursue something new. I was pretty over engineering at that point, but it’s not because I hated doing engineering work. The issue was more about the expectation that engineers solve problems, but don’t necessarily play a role in deciding which problems should be solved. How is it possible that those who implement solutions are discouraged from questioning the implications of their work? I ended up seeking a path where I could explore these ideas without fully abandoning my technical background. This led me to NYU ITP. In my personal statement for the ITP application, I asked what it meant to be a contemporary designer. A more relevant question now is: What does it mean to be a contemporary technologist? I’ve found that it means using my understanding of technology to contribute to a more equitable, sustainable, and joyful society. And that means considering the impact of our'">

That’s great most of the time, but in regards to personal data, having a frictionless network infrastructure might not be best for us. This zine is one third of my thesis, Slow Net, a series of experiments that explore how slow networks can be used to protect against data-collecting entities that threaten our autonomy and influence our identities.'

Targeted advertising is a common example of this info being used to determine what ad you’re most likely to interact with. Data can also be used as is.

Good examples include features like endless scrolling of newsfeeds or autoplay on streaming platforms to continuously give users individually tailored content. By working to capture our attention, companies are able to capture even more data. More personal data equals better ability to predict our future behaviors. If companies can predict your next steps, they can intervene and then guide you towards actions that align with their economic interests. A common example of this is when an app sends a push notification to your phone that then diverts your attention to something else. Instagram might grab your attention with a notification about someone you follow, and then before you know it you’re distracted with influencer content and ads. This seems kind of innocuous, but think of how masses of people could be influenced to fulfill certain actions or believe certain things through interventions that target specific profiles of people. The combination of these companies’ abilities to collect and gatekeep troves of data, capture our attention, and influence our behaviors amounts to a lot of control in their hands. So much control that the structure of this arrangement starts to reflect that of a feudal society.

When I talk about identity, I don’t only mean pieces of info like your address or credit card number. I am also talking about things that make up your personality - feelings, values, habits, interests, etc. These aspects that make us unique start to matter less because they are in service of an economic process rather than a social one. Humans become interchangeable collections of data and our differences only serve to provide diversity in a dataset. Our identities become privatized.

It’s the kind of problem that can’t be solved in one fell swoop.

Cutting out social media would make it harder to communicate with friends and family. Avoiding Google would be inconvenient, especially since NYU is tied up in Google apps. And so many of the sites we visit rely on Amazon Web Services (AWS), which makes it nearly impossible to evade. Boycotting is an action taken by consumers, but since we are the data laborers in this system, perhaps it makes more sense to think like a labor union. According to the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), slowdown strikes have a “long and honorable history” dating as far back as 1899 [3]. Slowdown strikes are when workers deliberately reduce their output and carry out their duties unproductively, which puts pressure on management to meet their demands. This tactic is especially effective when workers are a critical part of the supply-chain and inefficiency results in significant economic loss. Considering that these criteria apply to our role as data laborers, a similar strategy could be effective to resist influence from greedy companies.

The text reads: 'One of the most important uses of the Internet is communication. Our online conversations and interactions generate a lot of information that indicate our feelings, what we’re doing, what we want, and more. As of April 2019, Facebook clearly states in the data policy section of its terms of service that it’s collecting data from your communications. “We collect the content, communications and other information you provide when you use our Products, including when you sign up for an account, create or share content, and message or communicate with others.” This includes Instagram, Messenger, WhatsApp, and all their other products.

Simpler web design without extra features could allow users to focus on a single task, thereby encouraging people to do their business and move on. This might be perceived as inconvenient, but if users can accept this kind of change it would actually buy them more time to spend offline. We could be less obligated to our devices while still communicating what we need to say. An added bonus of simpler, ad-free, tracker-free sites is that they require less bandwidth and electricity to serve. Less excessive engagement on social media results in less data generated and collected.' // The next subsection is titled 'Breaking Real-Time Data Flow: Slowing the Network Layer'. An illustration of a traffic sign that says slow is on the right page. The text reads: 'Almost everyone has a router and modem in their home that connects their devices to the Internet. The router is an important point where someone can affect incoming and outgoing data for all devices that are connected to it.

As worries about tech addiction and our reliance on devices have become more frequent, several people claim that doing digital detoxes where they spend days, weeks, or months without their devices have been positive, perspective-changing experiences. In your increased offline time, you could connect with other humans IRL, get to know yourself better, and build an understanding of your personality without the influence of greedy companies. Cultivating and understanding your identity is not only beneficial to yourself. In his essay The Nature of Democratic Morale, Gordon Allport, a psychologist and researcher on human personality, wrote, “in a democracy every personality can be a citadel of resistance to tyranny” [4]. The idea that our individual opinions and actions make a difference and support each person’s autonomy in a democracy is extremely important.

At the application layer of the OSI model, changing the user experience design of apps would reduce engagement, thereby reducing the amount of personal data generated. At the network layer, limiting bandwidth prevents real-time data collection and prevents companies from influencing your behavior in the present. These slowdowns would work by: 1. Slowing the capture of personal data, 2. Encouraging more intentional action, 3. Creating opportunities for idle time and introspection. Collectively these actions attempt to preserve our autonomy and identity. Technology should be a tool that benefits humans and the world we live in.
